const lucianosDob = new Date("4 October, 2000 23:23:00");

// This function accepts a valid date object, subtracts it from Date.now() which is a built-in method that produces the current time value in milliseconds since epoch. This is then divided by 31536000000. Finally, this result would be in negative, so youâ€™ll be using Math.abs() to turn this into an absolute positive value. The .toPrecision() ensures you get a value that is precise to 4 points of the decimal.

const yearsTo = (date) => {
  const diff = (date - Date.now()) / 31536000000;
  return Math.abs(diff.toPrecision(4));
};

console.log(
  `Luciano was born on ${lucianosDob.toLocaleString(
    "pt-PT"
  )}. That was ${yearsTo(lucianosDob)} years ago!`
