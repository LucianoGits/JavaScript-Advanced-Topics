//In ansychronous JS, Promise is an intent to do something in the future but it's not guaranteed to be successful.


//there are three states of a PROMISE : (1)Pending(Rsult is still processing)---> (2)FAILED(rejected, when an error occurs) or (3) FULFILLED(Resolved, which means there was no error)

//.then is used to capture the successful result and .catch is to capture a failed promise
